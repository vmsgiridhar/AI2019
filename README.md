 Artificial Intelligence 2019

This repository contains code from the Udemy course on Machine Learning I completed on May 21, 2020.
Also instead of using the Python based libraries, I'm trying to write code from scratch based on the lectures by 
Andrew NG (https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229/47)
I will add those codes into AlgorithmsScratch folder in this Repository.
