    "* Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function.\n",
    "* To find a local minimum of a function using gradient descent, we take steps proportional to the negative of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point.\n",
    "* But if we instead take steps proportional to the positive of the gradient, we approach a local maximum of that function; the procedure is then known as gradient ascent. \n",
    "* Gradient descent was originally proposed by Cauchy in 1847."
