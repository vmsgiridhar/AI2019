Important Note: Linear Discriminant Analysis vs ANOVA (Analysis of Varience)
ANOVA uses Categorical Independent Variables and Continuous Dependent Variable.
LDA uses Continuous Independent Varaibales and a Categorical Dependent Variable. (Logistic Regression and Probit Regression are more related to LDA than ANOVA as they express a Categorical Dependent Variable by the continuous values of Independent variables.

1. Steps of Data Exploration and Preparation
Below are the steps involved to understand, clean and prepare your data for building your predictive model:

Variable Identification 
Univariate Analysis - Includes, Boxplot, Violinplot, Probability Density Function (PDF) & Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
Bi-variate Analysis
Missing values treatment
Outlier treatment
Variable transformation
Variable creation
Finally, we will need to iterate over steps 4 â€“ 7 multiple times before we come up with our refined model.
