Mutually Exclusive Events: Two events are mutually exclusive when they both cannot occur at the same time.

While flipping a coin:
Event A: The outcome is a Head
Event B: The outcome is a Tail

P(AUB) = P(A)+P(B)

Independent Events: Two events are said to be independent when the occurance of one event does not affect the outcome of other event and vice versa.

Event A: The first flip of a coin is a Head
Event B: The second flip of a coin is a Head

P(AUB) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A)*P(B)

Conditional Probability:
The probability of event X given that event y has already occured.
P(X|Y)

Formula of Conditional Probability, P(X|Y) = P(X and Y) / P(Y)

If X and Y are mutually exclusive.
P(X and Y) is 0
Hence, P(X|Y) = 0

If X and Y are independent events,
P(X and Y) is P(X)*P(Y)
Hence, P(X|Y) = P(X)

Product rule: P(X and y) = P(X|y)*P(Y)

Bayes Theorem

P(X and Y) = P(X|Y) * P(Y)
P(Y and X) = P(Y|X) * P(X)

as both P(X and Y), P(Y and X) are the same,

P(X|Y) = (P(Y|X) * P(X))/P(Y)
